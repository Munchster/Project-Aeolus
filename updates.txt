~ July 31, 2015
- Been working around the update flags, implementing the flags into the entity
- Hitmarks have been added into the entity, hitmarks are only showing block for some reason though.
- Redid all the hitmasks, fixed the hitmarks problem. Hitmarks use entity, and are very easy to use. All 4 hitmarks work perfectly. (normal, block, poison, and disease)
- Rewrote the entire commands, it was really crappy. The new command system has a very easy to use syntax.

~ August 1, 2015

- Added a command that allows you to restart the server remotely. Make sure the server is running through the run batch file.
- Also fixed getid command, now works perfectly.
- Server debug mode toggles the ability to log the entire outputstream to a log file. (Can be very useful in debugging situations)
- More logging done, now outputs all error messages done by the console.
